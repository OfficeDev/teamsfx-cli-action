### Workflow example for Continuous Deployment
```
name: Continuous Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      M365_ACCOUNT_NAME: ${{secrets.M365_ACCOUNT_NAME}}
      M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD: ${{secrets.M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD}}

      # To specify the env name for multi-env feature.
      TEAMSFX_ENV_NAME: staging
    steps:

      # Login Azure by service principal 
      - uses: OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action@v1
        with:
          commands: account login azure 
          service-principal: true
          username: ${{secrets.AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME}}
          password: ${{secrets.AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD}}

          commands: provision
          subscription: ${{secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}
          env: ${{env.TEAMSFX_ENV_NAME}}

      - uses: OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action@v1
        with:
          commands: deploy
          env: ${{env.TEAMSFX_ENV_NAME}}

        with:
          commands: publish
          env: ${{env.TEAMSFX_ENV_NAME}}
```

### Configure M365/Azure credentials as GitHub Secret:

To use any credentials, add them as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.

The table below lists all of the credentials required to login Azure and M365.
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME|The service principal name of Azure used to provision resources.|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD|The password of Azure service principal.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|To identify the subscription in which the resources will be provisioned.|
|AZURE_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the subscription resides.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_NAME|The M365 account for creating and publishing Teams App.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of M365 account.|
|M365_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the Teams App will be created/published.|

*PS:* To make M365 account credentials work in environment variables, there should not exist any interactive part of the login process, so extra configurations should be made. These operations have risks, so be aware of that and try to make your password complicated, and the way to login by device code will be supported in the future.
* For M365 account, the multi-factor authentication should be disabled (needs org admin's permission).
1. Login to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).
2. Click Users > Active users > Multi-factor authentication.
3. Select the M365 account you want to configure, click `disable` from the right panel.

To create Azure service principals for use, refer to [here](#how-to-create-azure-service-principals-for-use).

# How to create Azure service principals for use?
To provision and deploy resources targeting Azure inside CI/CD, you must create an Azure service principal for use.

Briefly, the steps include:
1. Register an Azure AD application in single tenant, and it requires sufficient permissions in your Azure AD tenant.
2. Assign a role to your Azure AD application to access your Azure subscription, and `Contributor` role is recommended. 
3. Create a new Azure AD application secret.
4. Grab your tenant id, application id(AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME), and the secret(AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD) for use.

For detailed guidelines, refer to [the official document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal). There're three ways to create service principal, [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal), [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli), and you can choose the way you like.
