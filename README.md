# GitHub Action for TeamsFx CLI


With TeamsFx CLI GitHub Action, you can automate your workflow by executing [TeamsFx CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teamsfx-cli) commands inside of an Action.

The definition of this GitHub Action is in [action.yml](https://github.com/OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action/blob/main/action.yml).

## Sample workflow 

### Dependencies on other GitHub Actions
* [Checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) â€“ **Required** To checkout the project code presents in your repository
### Workflow example for Continuous Deployment
```
name: Continuous Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME: ${{secrets.AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME}}
      AZURE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD: ${{secrets.AZURE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD}}
      AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}
      AZURE_TENANT_ID: ${{secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID}}
      M365_ACCOUNT_NAME: ${{secrets.M365_ACCOUNT_NAME}}
      M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD: ${{secrets.M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD}}
      M365_TENANT_ID: ${{secrets.M365_TENANT_ID}}

    steps:
      # Checkout the code.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      # Provision resources.
      - uses: OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action@v0
        with:
          commands: provision
          subscription: ${{env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}
    
      # Deploy the code.
      - uses: OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action@v0
        with:
          commands: deploy

      # Validate the manifest.
      - uses: OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action@v0
        with:
          commands: validate

      # Publish the Teams App.
      - uses: OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action@v0
        with:
          commands: publish
```

### Configure M365/Azure credentials as GitHub Secret:

To use any credentials, add them as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.

[TeamsFx CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teamsfx-cli) relies on environment variables to provide login credentials for Azure and M365. The table below lists all of the environment variables.
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME|The account name of Azure which is used to provision resources.|
|AZURE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of Azure account.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|To identify the subscription in which the resources will be provisined.|
|AZURE_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the subscription resides.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_NAME|The M365 account for creating and publishing Teams App.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of M365 account.|
|M365_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the Teams App will be created/published.|

*PS:* To make these credentials work in environment variables, there should not exist any interactive part of the login process, so extra configurations should be made.
1. The account's two-step authentication should be turned off.
2. The account's security defaults should be turned off.

In the meantime, the Azure/M365 accounts provided here should have sufficient permissions.
